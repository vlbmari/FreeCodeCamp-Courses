    <li>Chopped ham (200g)</li>
    <li>Chopped mozzarella cheese (200g)</li>

    <li>Peas (1 can)</li>
    <li>Rice Cooked (approximately 4 cups)</li>
    <li>Cream (2 cartons)</li>
    <li>Cream cheese (200 ml)</li>
    <li>Butter (2 tablespoons)</li>
    <li>Potato sticks</li>
    <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    <li>Black pepper (to taste)</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Season the cleaned shrimp with salt, lime juice, and pepper. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a pan and then add the shrimp.</li>
    <li>Sauté the shrimp. Be careful, as shrimp cooks very fast and becomes rubbery if overcooked; it is ready as soon as it turns pink.</li>
    <li>Add the peas, heavy cream, cream cheese, ham, and cheese. Once everything is mixed, add the rice.</li>
    <li>Transfer the mixture to a baking dish, cover with sliced mozzarella, and bake for about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, top with shoestring potatoes, and it is ready to serve.</li>
  </ol>
